## Quick Setup

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Run the app
python app.py

# 3. Open browser
http://localhost:5001
```

That's it! Upload a .docx file and start filling placeholders.

## Testing

Run the automated test suite to verify everything works:

```bash
# Option 1: From Testing directory
cd Testing
python test_app.py

# Option 2: From root directory
python Testing/test_app.py
```

**What the test does:**

- Extracts placeholders from `test_safe.docx`
- Fills them with sample data
- Verifies all replacements work correctly
- Creates `test_output.docx` with completed document

**Expected output:**

```
Found 11 placeholders
Document filled successfully!
All Tests Passed!
```

If tests fail, make sure:

- All dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `test_safe.docx` exists in the same folder as `test_app.py`
